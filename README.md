# BinarySearch

This is a Java program that performs binary search on a given list of numbers. Binary search is an efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
##Usage
1.Compile the Java file using the Java compiler:
```bash
javac BinarySearch.java
```
2.Run the compiled program:
```bash
java BinarySearch
```
3.Follow the prompts in the console to provide input:
- Enter a list of numbers: Enter a comma-separated list of integers.
- Enter the number you want to search for: Enter the integer you want to search for in the list.

4. The program will perform binary search on the given list and display the result:
- If the element is found, it will print "Element found at index [index]".
-If the element is not found, it will print "Element not found".

##Example

Enter a list of numbers: 5,12,17,23,29,33,41,56,62,78,89

Enter the number you want to search for: 33

Element found at index 5
